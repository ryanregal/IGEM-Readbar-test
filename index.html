            <h1>August</h1>
            <p>
              When Emma had been on her own as a kid, she’d learned to love the
              <b>summer</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Summer</b> had meant being warm without the aid of coats and
              blankets she couldn’t afford, had meant no one would look twice at
              a teenager wandering around alone during school hours, had meant
              bicycles left outside houses that it had been easy to borrow, just
              for as long as she’d needed them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab tab-1">
            <h1>September</h1>
            <p>
              It doesn’t go away, though it doesn’t darken, either. Emma is
              trapped in a curious sort of limbo with it, and she’s glad when
              it’s finally <b>autumn</b> and she has an excuse to wear jackets
              again that mostly conceal the mark.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regina doesn’t ask about it again, though she does say
              threateningly when they’re back-to-school shopping, “If you ever
              dress Henry in an eyesore like that jacket…”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab tab-2">
            <h1>October</h1>
            <p>
              <b>The mark</b> seems darker when she peers at it now, and she
              angles herself right up against the mirror in her apartment to try
              to read it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s still just a scribble, grey like latticework under her skin,
              and when she touches it, she feels an odd lurching in her stomach.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab tab-3">
            <h1>November</h1>
            <p>
              “So are you going to this...<b>Thanksgiving thing</b>?” Mulan
              wants to know, wrinkling her brow.
            </p>

            <p>
              They’re at the station on a quiet day, and there’s probably no
              excuse for Emma, David, Aladdin, and Mulan to be on duty except
              that it’s <b>donut day</b> and Granny has promised them fresh for
              the station today. “Belle suggested I come to the potluck at
              Granny’s, but I don’t know if I really understand the point.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab tab-4">
            <h1>December</h1>
            <p>
              <b>December</b> is extra cold this year, and Emma finds every
              excuse to wear scarves and turtlenecks, tugging them down on
              occasion only to study the mark on her skin.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s getting darker now, no longer easily mistaken as a smudge of
              dirt but something far more noticeable, and it’s settled into her
              skin with more permanence than any she’s had before.
              <b>She’s in love </b>, says common sense, but she can’t imagine
              how.
